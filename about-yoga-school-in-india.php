		<p>THE YOGA SCHOOL</p>
		<h1><span>Vision</span> of Gurukul Yogashala</h1>
		<p>Gurukul Yogashala, a revered yoga school, draws inspiration from the ancient Indian tradition of "Gurukul Pratha." Rooted in the Upanishads, this time-honored system of education has its origins in Vedic times.


In the Gurukul system, disciples (shishyas) reside with their teachers (gurus) under the same roof. The term "gurukula" is derived from Sanskrit, where "guru" signifies a teacher or master, and "kula" refers to a family or home. It represents a nurturing environment where students are mentored by knowledgeable gurus in various Vidyas (knowledge) and Kalas (arts).</p>

<p>
The guru-shishya tradition holds deep significance in the fabric of Sanatan Sanskriti (eternal culture), and echoes in other traditions like Buddhism within India. In contemporary times, the term "gurukul" is also used to denote residential monasteries or yoga schools established by modern gurus.</p>
</p>

<p>
Gurukul Yogashala, as a yoga school, embraces the sacred tradition of the guru-shishya relationship while offering a modern and comprehensive approach to yoga education.We honor the essence of the guru-shishya relationship by creating a family-like atmosphere within our yoga school. We believe that a close-knit community enhances the learning process and facilitates personal growth. Our students become part of the Gurukul family, where they receive guidance, support, and encouragement on their yoga journey.
