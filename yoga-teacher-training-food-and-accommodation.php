		<h2>SATTVIC FOOD FOR YOGI</h2>
	
	</div>
	<div class="fc_acco_c1">
		<p>Gurukul Yogashala Rishikesh takes great pride in providing our students with healthy and nourishing food during their stay with us. We understand that the food we eat has a direct impact on our health, well-being, and ability to practice yoga effectively. Therefore, we offer a balanced and gluten-free yogic diet that provides all the necessary vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, and other minerals to give you the energy to begin your yoga practice.
We believe that nutrition is an essential aspect of yoga and meditation. Our body, mind, and spirit require proper nourishment to remain healthy and support our yoga practice. Eating a sattvic and hygienic diet provides divine energy that helps to perform yoga practice correctly. At Gurukul Yogashala Rishikesh, we prioritize providing healthy and appropriate cuisine to our students, understanding that food is a crucial aspect of the yoga programs we offer.</p>
<p>
Our vegetarian meals are freshly prepared daily and include seasonal fruits and vegetables. We take care to provide authentic Indian food to give our students an authentic experience of Indian culture. Additionally, we provide access to filtered water at all times.
